      <description>Some helpful resources for studying deep learning. There are many great course pages with recorded lectures, slides, practice problems.
Main NYU Deep Learning (w/ Yann LeCun) Yann LeCun&amp;rsquo;s graduate level deep learning course. Interesting energy-based model approach and connections to representation learning. UvA Deep Learning Notebooks Great introduction to PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric. Implementation and explanation of many things discussed in NYU LeCun course. Attention, GNN message passing, energy based models, autoencoders, variational inference.</description>
