      <description>This webpage was set up using HUGO, a static site generator, using the Lowkey theme. Later I painlessly switched to the Astatine theme. With the static site generator, adding content amounts to changing a markdown file, then CSS is generated by the theme&amp;rsquo;s template.</description>
