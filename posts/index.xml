      <description>Some helpful resources for studying deep learning. There are many great course pages with recorded lectures, slides, practice problems.
Main NYU Deep Learning (w/ Yann LeCun) Yann LeCun&amp;rsquo;s graduate level deep learning course. Interesting energy-based model approach and connections to representation learning. UvA Deep Learning Notebooks Great introduction to PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric. Implementation and explanation of many things discussed in NYU LeCun course. Attention, GNN message passing, energy based models, autoencoders, variational inference.</description>

      <description>This webpage was set up using HUGO, a static site generator, using the Lowkey theme. Later I painlessly switched to the Astatine theme. With the static site generator, adding content amounts to changing a markdown file, then CSS is generated by the theme&amp;rsquo;s template.</description>
