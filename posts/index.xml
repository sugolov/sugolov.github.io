      <description>NYU Deep Learning (w/ Yann LeCun) Yann LeCun&amp;rsquo;s graduate level deep learning course. Interesting energy-based model approach and connections to representation learning. UvA Deep Learning Notebooks Great introduction to PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric. Implementation and explanation of many things discussed in NYU LeCun course. Attention, GNN message passing, energy based models, autoencoders, variational inference. UofT Deep Learning: Theory &amp;amp; Data Science Deep learning course at U of T by Vardan Papyan. Transformer Family Blog Post Blog post about the family of transformer based architectures.</description>
