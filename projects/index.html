    Learned how to work with genetic data, statistical tools for GWAS, and later practiced running GWAS independently.
    Documented and prepared a manual for using publicly available gene expression data from 1000 Genomes individuals.
    Lead a workshop where we conducted a sample GWAS that identified the region in the genome significantly
    associated with ERAP2 gene expression in a subset of 1000 Genomes individuals.

    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="/blog/files/sta302a2.pdf">STA302 Final Project</a>. The final project for STA302: Data Analysis I,
            which investigates the effect of current smoking status on average systolic blood pressure in a publicly available
            cross sectional dataset. Includes
            variable selection, cross validation, assumption checking, prediction on test data, and discussion.

            <a href="https://github.com/sugolov/CSC207-Course-Scheduler">U of T Course Scheduling Application</a>. The team's CSC207: Software Design course project. We created a command line application that generates student timetables satisfying
            user specified criteria. The goal of the project was to follow clean architecture and the SOLID principles
            of software design.
