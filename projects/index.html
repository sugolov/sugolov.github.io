   <a href="https://github.com/sugolov/GWAS-Workshop">GWAS</a>
</h2>
<p>
    We learned how to work with genetic data, statistical tools for GWAS, and later practiced running GWAS independently.
    Our steps were documented and used to prepare a manual for a GWAS workshop.
    We later lead the workshop where we conducted a sample GWAS that identified the region in the genome significantly
    associated with ERAP2 gene expression in a subset of 1000 Genomes individuals.

            <a href="https://github.com/sugolov/CSC207-Course-Scheduler">U of T Course Scheduling Application</a>. My team's CSC207: Software Design course project. We created a command line application that generates student timetables satisfying
            user specified criteria. The goal of the project was to follow clean architecture and the SOLID principles
            of software design.
