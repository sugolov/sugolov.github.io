</h2>
<p>
    I prepared and lead a workshop about Genome Wide Association Studies. We replicated a sample GWAS that identified the region in the
    genome significantly associated with ERAP2 gene expression in 1000 Genomes individuals, which was the location of the
    ERAP2 gene itself. Please see the repository for more details (while this section is expanded)

    <a href="https://github.com/sugolov/CSC207-Course-Scheduler">U of T Course Scheduling Application</a>
</h2>
<p>
    My team's CSC207: Software Design course project. We created a command line application that generates student timetables satisfying
    user specified criteria. The goal of the project was to follow clean architecture and the SOLID principles
    of software design.
