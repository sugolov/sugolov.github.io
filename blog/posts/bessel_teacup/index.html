    I recorded the standing wave pattern in a vibrating teacup. These are described by Bessel functions,
    which I briefly encountered in a problem set. This post is a write-up about them.

    To the left is what was recorded in the teacup, and to the right is a gif of a particular Bessel function.
    Bessel functions describe the movement of a drum-like circular membrane along its radius.
