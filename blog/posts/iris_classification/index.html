    This winter break I decided to try my hand at self-studying ML and TensorFlow.
    I followed Google's Machine Learning Crash Course and Chollet's Deep Learning with Python, and gained an
    understanding of some machine learning basics. As an exercise, I trained a multiclass categorization model for
    the Iris dataset (<a href="https://github.com/sugolov/ml-exercises/blob/main/iris/iris.ipynb">Jupyter Notebook</a>).

    <br> <br>
    This was a first glance at ML, and I understood the high level process of training a model.
    Some data science basics (in the form of test/validation sets and general
    working with data) were introduced as well. However, these felt oriented towards developers whose ultimate goal is
    implementing ML models as soon as possible. I think it would be nice to gain a solid foundation in the underlying
    statistics before
    trying other ML projects, so I look forward to STA314 and STA414.
